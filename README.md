# pyitc_gemini

This provides scripts for running the Gemini Observatory integration time calculators (ITCs) programmatically.

Requirements

For Selenium:
* [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev) >= v3
* [Geckodriver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Headless_mode) 

The examples have been most recently tested using Python 3.6, Selenium 3.141.0, and geckodriver 0.25.

This code has been only minimally tested and Gemini Observatory does not guarantee the results. Use is "at your own risk."
